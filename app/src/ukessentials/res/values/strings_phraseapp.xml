  <string name="learn_more.blood_pressure_section_1_message_234">Blood pressure is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of your blood vessels. Blood pressure is usually described as your systolic blood pressure over your diastolic blood pressure, for example, 140/90. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during a maximum of one heartbeat. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries between a minimum of two heartbeats. This is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). An optimal blood pressure reading is 120/80 or less.</string>
  <string name="learn_more.blood_pressure_section_2_message_235">High blood pressure or hypertension (higher than 120/80) can weaken blood vessels and damage organs. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to conditions such as stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure.</string>

  <string name="learn_more.bmi_detail_section_1_titile_211">What is Body Mass Index?</string>
  <string name="learn_more.bmi_section_1_message_225">Your Body Mass Index is a calculation that takes into account both your height and your weight. It’s not always an accurate representation for people who have more lean muscle mass than average, for example athletes.  This is because muscle is heavier than fat. That’s why we’ll also take your waist circumference into account if your BMI is between 25 and 29.9.</string>
  <string name="learn_more.bmi_section_2_message_226">Your Body Mass Index indicates how your weight could be considered healthy or unhealthy:\n• Below 18.5: underweight\n• Between 18.5 and 24.9: healthy weight\n• Between 25.0 and 29.9: possibly overweight (depending on waist circumference)\n• Above 30: obese (in normal populations)</string>

  <string name="learn_more.cholesterol_detail_section_1_title_215">What is Cholesterol?</string>
  <string name="learn_more.cholesterol_section_1_message_237">Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance your liver produces. You need some cholesterol to form cell membranes, certain hormones, and Vitamin D. Your body absorbs cholesterol from some foods, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products. Your total cholesterol level is made up of reading the levels of HDL, LDL, and triglycerides in your blood.\n\nAlso known as \"good\" cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) is an indicator of risk for heart attack or stroke. HDL carries cholesterol out of the bloodstream to the liver, preventing cholesterol and plaque build-up in the arteries. An HDL measure of above 1.0mmol/L is considered healthy for men, and above 1.3mmol/L is considered healthy for women. When looked at in conjunction with total cholesterol, a ratio of Total Cholesterol:HDL below 5.0 is considered healthy for men; women should aim for a ratio below 3.9.\n\nAlso known as \"bad\" cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, (LDL cholesterol) is an indicator of risk for heart attack or stroke. LDL is a carrier of cholesterol in the blood. Therefore, an optimal reading of LDL cholesterol is less than 3.0mmol/L.\n\nTriglycerides are the most common type of fat in your body and are found in your blood and in fat tissue. A major source of energy, they form from extra calories your body does not use immediately for energy and are stored in fat cells for later needs.</string>
  <string name="learn_more.cholesterol_section_2_message_238">Too much cholesterol can be harmful as it may increase your risk of developing heart disease and stroke. It leads to a build-up of fatty deposits (plaque) in the blood vessels that then blocks blood flowing to the heart, brain, and other important organs. An optimal total cholesterol reading is less than 5.0mmol/L.\n\nHigh levels of LDL cholesterol combine with other substances to form the waxy plaque deposits that can eventually clog arteries leading to the heart and brain, not giving them oxygen. This could then lead to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nIn normal amounts (below 1.7mmol/L), triglycerides are important for good health. High levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream (1.7mmol/L and higher) have been linked to atherosclerosis (the hardening and narrowing of arteries), high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and increased waist circumference.</string>

Then submit the results to Vitality as part of your Vitality Health Check.  \n\nYou earn %1$s points for submitting your results, and an extra %2$s if those results are in the healthy range.  \n\nThese points are valid for each year’s membership only.</string>

  <string name="learn_more.glucose_section_1_message_231">Glucose, commonly called sugar, is an important energy source all the cells and organs of our bodies need.\n\nThe random blood glucose test: This blood test measures the level of blood sugar (also called blood glucose in your blood). A random glucose reading of less than 7.8mmol/L is optimal.\n\nThe fasting blood glucose level test: This blood test measures the level of blood sugar in your plasma. It’s also called a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test or a fasting blood sugar test. A fasting glucose reading of less than 6.1mmol/L is optimal.</string>
  <string name="learn_more.glucose_section_2_message_232">The fasting blood glucose level test detects if you have diabetes or if you have pre-diabetes. Pre-diabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as full-blown diabetes. If you have pre-diabetes, you’re at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You are also at increased risk of developing heart disease, unless you adopt a healthier lifestyle that includes weight loss and more physical activity.</string>

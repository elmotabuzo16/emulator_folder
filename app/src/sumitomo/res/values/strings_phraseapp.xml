  <string name="learn_more.blood_pressure_section_1_message_234">Blood pressure is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of your blood vessels. Blood pressure is usually described as your systolic blood pressure over your diastolic blood pressure, for example, 140/90. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during a maximum of one heartbeat. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries between a minimum of two heartbeats. This is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). An optimal blood pressure reading is less than 140/90.</string>
  <string name="learn_more.blood_pressure_section_2_message_235">High blood pressure or hypertension (140/90 mmHg or higher) can weaken blood vessels and damage organs. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to conditions such as stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure.</string>

  <string name="learn_more.bmi_detail_section_1_titile_211">What is Body Mass Index?</string>
  <string name="learn_more.bmi_section_1_message_225">Your Body Mass Index is a calculation that takes into account both your height and your weight. It is more accurate than simply considering your weight. Yet it may inaccurately indicate body composition in populations with lean muscle mass that is more than average, for example, athletes. This is because muscle is heavier than fat, and this may throw off the calculation.</string>
  <string name="learn_more.bmi_section_2_message_226">A Body Mass Index indicates how your weight could be considered healthy or unhealthy: \n•	Below 18.5: underweight\n•	Between 18.5 and 24.9: healthy weight\n•	Above 24.9: overweight\n•	Above 30: obese (in normal populations)\n</string>

  <string name="learn_more.cholesterol_detail_section_1_title_215">What is Cholesterol?</string>
  <string name="learn_more.cholesterol_section_1_message_237">Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance your liver produces. You need some cholesterol to form cell membranes, certain hormones, and Vitamin D. Your body absorbs cholesterol from some foods, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products. Your total cholesterol level is made up of reading the levels of HDL, LDL, and triglycerides in your blood.\n\nAlso known as \"bad\" cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, (LDL cholesterol) is an indicator of risk for heart attack or stroke. LDL is a carrier of cholesterol in the blood. Therefore, an optimal reading of LDL cholesterol is less than 2.6mmol/L.\n</string>
  <string name="learn_more.cholesterol_section_2_message_238">Too much cholesterol can be harmful as it may increase one’s risk of developing heart disease and stroke. It leads to a build-up of fatty deposits (plaque) in the blood vessels that then blocks blood flowing to the heart.\n\nHigh levels of LDL cholesterol combine with other substances to form the waxy plaque deposits that can eventually clog arteries leading to the heart and brain, not giving them oxygen. This could then lead to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nIn normal amounts (below 1.7mmol/L), triglycerides are important for good health. High levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream (1.7mmol/L and higher) have been linked to atherosclerosis (the hardening and narrowing of arteries), high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and increased waist circumference.\n</string>

  <string name="learn_more.glucose_section_1_message_231">Glucose, commonly called sugar, is an important energy source all the cells and organs of our bodies need. \n\nThe random blood glucose test: This blood test measures the level of blood sugar (also called blood glucose in your blood). A random glucose reading of less than 7.8mmol/L is optimal.\n\nThe fasting blood glucose level test: This blood test measures the level of blood sugar in your plasma. It’s also called a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test or a fasting blood sugar test. A fasting glucose reading of less than 6.1mmol/L is optimal.\n</string>
  <string name="learn_more.glucose_section_2_message_232">The fasting blood glucose level test detects if you have diabetes or if you have pre-diabetes. Pre-diabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as full-blown diabetes. If you have pre-diabetes, you’re at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You are also at increased risk of developing heart disease, unless you adopt a healthier lifestyle that includes weight loss and more physical activity.</string>
